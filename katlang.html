    <h1>Katlang</h1>
    <h4>Also known as mewr morp mruw :3</h4>
    <hr>


    <h2>Letters</h2>
    <p>
    Vowels: /a/, e*, i (/e/), /o/, /u/, y (/<i class="ipa">ɪ</i>/) <br>
    Consonants: /m/, r (/<i class="ipa">ɹ</i>/), /p/, /w/ <br><br>

    * The e is pronounced differently depending on the letter that comes after it. <br>
    Vowel after e -> /i/ <br>
    Consonant after e -> /<i class="ipa">ɛ</i>/ <br><br>
    </p>


    <h2>Punctuation</h2>
    <p>
    There are 9 punctuation marks in katlang <br><br>

    :3 - Happy (positive) <br>
    :E - Sad (negative) <br>
    :1 - Neutral/Indifferent <br>
    :? - Inquisitive or confused <br>
    :P - Silly (satire or joking) <br>
    :O - Suprised or astonished <br>
    >:3 - Threat (silly) <br>
    >:E - Threat (threat) <br>
    ;3 - Romantic <br><br>

    These mark the end of a sentence. <br>
    </p>


    <h2>Sentence Structure</h2>
    <p>
    Object-Verb-Subject <br><br>

    If there is no subject in the sentence, the implied subject is the person speaking. <br>
    </p>


    <h2>Adjectives</h2>
    <p>
    Adjectives/Adverbs are placed inside of other words. Each word has a dedicated splitting point where each adj/adv are supposed to go. <br><br>

    mroaw - time <br>
    mrooaaw - past <br>
    mroiiaw - present <br>
    mroaoaw - future <br>

    To show these splitting points, the lexicon will have a vertical line in between words (me|ow). If a word doesn't have a splitting point, then adjectives cannot be added onto it. <br><br>

    Words with aa in them go after the word they are describing. <br>
    </p>


    <h2>Loanwords</h2>
    <p>
    Any names or loanwords containing the latin alphabet must be converted into Katlang first. <br><br>

    Use the following chart to do so: <br>
    a, x >> a <br>
    i >> e <br>
    e >> i <br>
    o >> o <br>
    u, v >> u <br>
    j, y, z >> y <br><br>

    c, m, n >> m <br>
    g, h, k, s >> r <br>
    b, d, f, p, q >> p <br>
    l, r, t, w >> w <br><br>
    
    After conversion, duplicate letters are removed. (ex. wrapping -> wwappemr -> wapemr) <br>

    The first letter in a name is always capitalized. <br>
    Names are always treated after adjectives (placed after described noun) but no "aa" is needed. <br>
    Loanwords are instead placed into the sentence by inserting "merp [loanword] merp", no matter if the letters/characters were converted to katlang or not. <br><br>

    Examples: <br>
    I'm going to Walmart -> mreaw mraaew Wawmaw merw meww <br>
    That's a <i class="lnwd">猫</i> -> merp <i class="lnwd">猫</i> merp mrrw myww <br><br>
    </p>


    <h2>Word Parsing</h2>
    <p>
    This is a quick guide to breaking apart complex words in Katlang. <br><br>

    The first part of any word will always consist of either 2 or 3 letters <br>
    The last part will always consist of 2 <br>
    The middle part will always be an even number <br><br>

    Example word: myryoieeuaw <br><br>

    1) Count the total amount of letters <br>
    > If it's odd, the first part has 3 letters <br>
    > If its even, it has two <br>
    - myryoieeuaw has 11 letters, so the first section consists of 3 letters <br>
    2) Seperate the word into sections <br>
    - myryoieeuaw -> myr|yoieeu|aw <br>
    3) Combine the first and last parts to determine the base word <br>
    - myr|aw -> a quality <br>
    4) split up the middle part into twos to find each individual adjective <br>
    - yoieeu -> yo|ie|eu <br>
    - yo -> old <br>
    - ie & eu -> orange & dark -> brown <br>

    - a quality (of something) that is old and brown -> probably rust <br>
    - myryoieeuaw -> rust <br>
    </p>
