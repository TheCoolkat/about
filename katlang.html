    <h1>Katlang</h1>
    <h4>Also known as mewr mraauw Myariamyw :3</h4>
    <hr>

    <h2>Letters</h2>
    <p>
    Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y <br>
    Consonants: m, r, p, w <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Tone</h2>
    <p>
    There are 9 tones in katlang <br><br>

    :3 - Happy (positive) <br>
    :E - Sad (negative) <br>
    :1 - Neutral <br>
    :? - Inquisitive or confused <br>
    :P - Silly (satire or joking) <br>
    :O - Suprised or astonished <br>
    >:3 - Threat (silly) <br>
    >:E - Threat (threat) <br>
    ;3 - Romantic <br><br>

    Tones mark the end of a sentence.
    </p>

    <h2>Sentence Structure</h2>
    <p>
    Object-Verb-Subject <br><br>

    If there is no subject in the sentence, the implied subject is the person speaking.
    </p>

    <h2>Adjectives</h2>
    <p>
    Adjectives/Adverbs are placed inside of other words. Each word has a dedicated splitting point where each adj/adv are supposed to go. <br><br>

    mroaw - time <br>
    mrooaaw - past <br>
    mroiiaw - present <br>
    mroaoaw - future <br>

    To show these splitting points, the lexicon will have a vertical line in between words (me|ow). If a word doesn't have a splitting point, then adjectives cannot be added onto it. <br><br>

    Words with aa in them go after the word they are describing.
    </p>

    <h2>Names</h2>
    <p>
    There are only 10 characters so names are likely going to be very weird. <br>

    The first letter in a name will always be the letter m. <br>
    The last letter can be any consonant other than m. <br><br>

    If a name doesn't start with m, the letter m can either be added on or the first letter in the name can be replaced with the letter m. The same applies to the letter at the end if it isn't w, p, or r. <br><br>

    Heres a list for converting letters in english to letters in katlang, though this is heavily up to interpretation. <br><br>

    z >> e <br>
    j, l >> i <br>
    q, v >> u <br>
    c, g, k, x >> y <br>
    n, s >> m <br>
    f, h, t >> r <br>
    b, d >> p <br><br>

    The first letter in a name is always capitalized. <br>
    Names are always interpreted as adjectives (and therefore go after the noun). <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Word Parsing</h2>
    <p>
    This is a quick section about how to break apart complex words in Katlang. <br><br>

    Words are parsed from the outside in. <br>
    The first part of the word will always consist of either 2 or 3 letters <br>
    The last part will always consist of 2 <br>
    The middle part will always be an even number <br><br>

    Example word: myryoieeuaw <br><br>

    1) Count the total amount of letters <br>
    > If it's odd, the first part has 3 letters <br>
    > If its even, it has two <br>
    - myryoieeuaw has 11 letters, so the first section consists of 3 letters <br>
    2) Seperate the word into sections <br>
    - myryoieeuaw -> myr|yoieeu|aw <br>
    3) Combine the first and last parts to determine the base word <br>
    - myr|aw -> a quality <br>
    4) split up the middle part into twos to find each individual adjective <br>
    - yoieeu -> yo|ie|eu <br>
    - yo -> old <br>
    - ie & eu -> orange & dark -> brown <br>

    - a quality (of something) that is old and brown -> probably rust <br>
    - myryoieeuaw -> rust <br>
    </p>
