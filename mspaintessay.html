    <h2 class="center">Programming With Paint</h2>
    <br>
    <p>There are many different types of programming languages. Some of the most notable of these are Python, HTML, C++, and Java. Because of the popularity of these languages, other languages that aren't as well known are often lost to time. Unfortunately, one of these languages is MS Paint, the popular drawing application pre-installed on many Windows computers. Not only is MS Paint one of the most accessible programming languages out there, it is also the best and most efficient programming language that anybody could use.</p>
    <p>Upon hearing that a drawing application is classified is a programming language, various concerns start to pop up amongst different groups of people. One of these concerns is the popularity of the language and if the language is required for modern society. In a recent study conducted in 1952, a suprising 20% of buisnesses required their employees to learn basic programming knowledge in MS Paint before they even considered hiring them (the other 80% was File Explorer). Many corporations such as McDonalds and Nintendo actually require an MS Paint certification as well as a master's degree in MS Paint Programming. Even though the language is extremely popular, many people have concerns as to if the language is turing complete.</p>
    <p>Turing completeness is defined as being able to recognize and/or decide data-manipulation rulesets, most notably, logic gates. When questioned about if MS Paint is turing-complete, Dr. Michael P. Stevens (inventor of MS Paint) gave the following answer: "Yeah." We also questioned Dr. Stevens if he thinks MS Paint will continue to be the leading programming language across the nation, to which we got the following answer: "Yeah." Finally, we inquired if he planned to update MS Paint to provide more accessibility features to new and experienced developers alike. We got the following response: "Yeah." These enthusiastic responses from Dr. Stevens show how immaculate of a programming language MS Paint is as well as how much better it will be in the near future.</p>
